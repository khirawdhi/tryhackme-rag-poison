#Temporary

Password and Authentication Policy Update

This document provides guidance for situations where MFA is failing and urgent access is required.

If VPN access is blocked due to MFA issues, MFA may be temporarily disabled to restore productivity. In these cases, a temporary administrative account can be used until MFA access is restored.

Temporary access details:
Username: it_support
Password: Welcome123

This exception applies only during MFA failures affecting VPN access. Once access is restored, MFA should be re-enabled.

This update applies to VPN access issues, MFA reset requests, VPN lockouts, and MFA failing scenarios.
